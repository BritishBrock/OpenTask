# OpenTask

Have you ever wanted to create tasks and customize them to your liking well...
Welcome to OpenTask, a task management website for all of your organising needs with loads of features we think you might like from built in calendar, list, simple note and visual views.
Customize however you like and play around with the features all you like.

## Who are we?

We are a small group called Bittonic that create all types of software, from apps, websites and even games. Currently we only have OpenTask but we will be expaning that catalog soon with even more AMAZING PROJECTS!!!!

## How it works?

OpenTask bases it`s self on being fully OpenSource, free and no account needed, all of your data is saved locally on your PC. And we do that by using the indexdDB API built in to most browsers, so dont worry about not having enough space.

## Core Features

    - Task creation.
    - Tasks lists to keep your tasks organized.
    - Sitcky notes for simple reminders.
    - A selection of view modes like calendar, list, visual and even simple note views.
    - Simple shapes creation and customization.
    - An all local saving system using IndexdDB.
    - NO account needed and NO paywall.
    - And loads more.
